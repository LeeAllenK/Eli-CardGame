 Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript <br/>
  My learning was focused on using Javascript fetch() API. In doing this I was able to render a deck of 52 standard cards,
  testing whether the cards or similar value are a match.

  When I improve this project, I would update the type of cards that could be chosen. I would focus on using React to build and React Native for a mobile approach.
